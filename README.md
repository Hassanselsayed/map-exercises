This project was primarily developed during a JavaScript course I took with [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman). He designed the project and I coded along with him during the course. Figure 1 shows the flowchart of what exactly was developed during the course.

After the course, I decided to take the project a few steps further and add the following functionalities myself:
<!-- 1. edit any workout -->
<!-- 2. delete a workout -->
<!-- 3. delete all workouts -->
<!-- 4. sort workouts by a certain fields (distance or duration) -->
<!-- 5. rebuild running and cycling objects coming from local storage -->
<!-- 6. better error and confirmation messages -->
<!-- 7. ability to position map to position ALL workouts (important) -->
<!-- 8. ability to draw lines and shapes, instead of points -->
<!-- 9. geocode location from coordinates ("Run in Faro, Portugal") -->
<!-- 10. display weather data for workout time and place -->
